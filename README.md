===================

Dependencies: python-mdp, python-numpy

NOTE: USE api.py FOR ALL CLASSES. DO NOT USE THE FILES THEMSELVES; THEY ARE NOT UP-TO-DATE.





In api.py:
Use the Algorithm class as a base for any algorithm you wish to add. Extend the class. It keeps things nice and pretty.
Use Algorithm.runAlgorithm() as the method to do the bulk of your work in. Getters and setters are nice too.

In Progress:
PrincipalComponentAnalysis (PCA)
DSDR

Incomplete:
