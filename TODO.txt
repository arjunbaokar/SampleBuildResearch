implement PCA

eig(symmetric matrix):
	find library to solve eigenvectors (basically eigenvector solver)

eig(Atranspose * A) => A is nxp matrix
At = A transpose

S = sigma
1. S = AtA
2. Xo = random p-dimensional vector
3. Xn = S(Xn-1)
4. Xn = Xn/||Xn||  <= normalize Xn
5. back to 3 until ||X_n - X_(n-1)|| < delta

find library that gives eigenvectors incrementally (largest k eigenvectors), not all at once
